In this how-to guide, we will install libunicornpkg and unicorntool onto a computer.

This guide requires access to the HTTP API.

1. Execute `wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unicornpkg/wing/main/install.lua`. This script bootstraps Wing onto your system. Wing is the official distribution of unicornpkg.
2. Add `/bin` to your `shell.path`. There is a script to bootstrap this, available by executing `/bin/hoof install unix-path-bootstrap`, and then restarting your system.
3. You're done! Check out other how-tos.
