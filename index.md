> unicornpkg: A package manager for ComputerCraft that doesn't suck.

unicornpkg is a package manager for ComputerCraft that aims to be reliable, long-lived, and sane.

[Installation](./how-tos/installation.md){: .btn .btn-purple } [View on GitHub](http://github.com/unicornpkg/libunicornpkg){: .btn }

It's built on the concept of [*package tables*](./specification/package-tables.md) and [*package providers*](./specification/package-providers/index.md). Package tables are the packages themselves, and the package providers install the package. [*Package remotes*](./specification/package-remotes.md) allow you to download package tables in a manner similar to other package managers.
