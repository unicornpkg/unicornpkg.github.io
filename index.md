> unicornpkg: A package manager for ComputerCraft that doesn't suck.

unicornpkg is a package manager for ComputerCraft that aims to be reliable, long-lived, and sane.

It's built on the concept of [*package tables*](./specification/package-tables.md) and [*package providers*](./specification/package-providers/index.md). Package tables are the packages themselves, and the package providers install the package. [*Package remotes*](./specification/package-remotes.md) will allow you to download package tables in a manner similar to other package managers.
