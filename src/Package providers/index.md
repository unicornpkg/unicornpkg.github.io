title: Package providers
---

**Package providers** are the workhorse of unicornpkg; they allow you to use various online services to install packages.

The built-in package providers are [`com.pastebin`](./com.pastebin.md), [`dev.devbin`](./dev.devbin.md), [`com.github`](./com.github.md), [`com.github.gist`](./com.github.gist.md), [`com.gitlab`](./com.gitlab.md), and [`org.bitbucket`](./org.bitbucket.md). Custom providers will be creatable in the future.
